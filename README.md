# SF | SPOTIFY

## Why Spotify?
Being a music lover, I am very much interested to create some new features in music apps.
I think this app can serve its best if it can improve its performance by solving some problems which me as a user felt it a bit difficult to use the app.

## Feature 1
People at present are becoming so creative that they make remixes of songs.
But let's say we have a song and there were 90 remixes.
If a user want to hear the original song (subjected to the condition that remixes are so popular than original song.)
It will be a very difficult task for him to search and also sometimes by right search too the results will not show it.

This can be solved by considering the first uploaded song as original
And identifying the remixes of songs if there is >95% of lyrics match.
Or even with the tune.

This can be named as ultra search with and option of sort by i.e. by original, by popularity, by song duration.

## Feature 2
Nowadays Everyone wants to become a dj of their own with the music apps.
An equilizer will be there which controls the tune, lyrics and volume levels.

With a increase in tune or keeping a 10secs repeat mode, they can create their own remix and can hear their own version

Also, of they like it so much that they want to upload it then they can upto 5 songs in free acount.

Ad revenue for this plays will shared between the remix creator and spotify 

## Feature 3
Lyrics translation.
With the help of ML and NLP, we can create a translated lyrics or even the whole song with it.

Eg. If I like the song daspecito, then why should I wait for someone to create it Hindi version when we have Ai ðŸ˜‰

## Feature 4
Feedback revenue.
Since Spotify has a large user base, so they can now afford to conducting feedbacks.
In that revenue If we give 20% to the user for answering then it can keep this alive.

## Feature 5
Auto stop
There are many people who likes to hear songs before sleeping.
While listening they will fall into sleep. At this time playing the songs for ads won't make any sense.
In fact this may create negative impression.
To overcome this we are creating an auto stop which will ask user to play more songs per every 10 songs.
If user responds yes then it will play
In all other cases it will stop the music from playing.
