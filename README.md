## Why Spotify?
Being a music lover, I am very much interested to create some new features in music apps. \
I think this app can serve its best if it can improve its performance by solving some problems which me as a user felt it a bit difficult to use the app.

## Feature 1
**Name**:- remix seperator \
**Idea**:- \
People at present are becoming so creative that they make remixes of songs. \
Eg :- let's say we have a song and there were 90 remixes. \
If a user want to hear the original song (subjected to the condition that remixes are so popular than original song.) \
It will be a very difficult task for him to search and also sometimes by right search too the results will not show it. \
This can be solved by considering the first uploaded song as original \
And identifying the remixes of songs if there is >95% of lyrics match. \
Or even with the tune. \
This can be named as ultra search with and option of sort by i.e. by original, by popularity, by song duration. \
**Target audience**:- end user
**Benefit to Spotify**:- user firendly 

## Feature 2
**Name**:- Equilizer \
**Idea**:- \
Nowadays Everyone wants to become a dj of their own with the music apps.
An equilizer will be there which controls the tune, lyrics and volume levels. \
With a increase in tune or keeping a 10secs repeat mode, they can create their own remix and can hear their own version \
In addition, they will get some instrument voices which they can overlap and modify to make a new song. \
Also, of they like it so much that they want to upload it then they can upto 5 songs in free acount. \
A partly payment of playbacks will be offered from the spotify side(like for songs which get more than 1K playbacks). \
**Target audience**:- Music and Remix creators
**Benefit to Spotify**:- Both user firendly and revenue generation

## Feature 3
**Name**:- Lyrics translation \
**Idea**:- \
With the help of ML and NLP, we can create a translated lyrics or even the whole song with it. \
Eg. If I like the song daspecito, then why should I wait for someone to create it Hindi version when we have Ai.  \
**Target audience**:- world wide users who likes different language songs
**Benefit to Spotify**:- User firendly

## Feature 4
**Name**:- Feedback \
**Idea**:- \
Since Spotify has a large user base, so they can now afford to conducting feedbacks. \
In that revenue If we give 20% to the user for answering then it can keep this alive. \
It can also have the potential to porvide a better alternative for the ad revenue system. \
**Target audience**:- users who like to earn money by surveys
**Benefit to Spotify**:- Revenue generation

## Feature 5
**Name**:- Auto Stop \
**Idea**:-
The timer in spotify is not a good option for auto off because the user dont know when he will sleep exatly. \
Keeping a short timers till the user will sleep is not a good idea. \
A long timer is a good option but it can be improved by a response system. \
**Response System**:-
A response system will by default have a timer of 15-20mins. It will check for the user's response. after the completion of timer. \
Response can either be the form of mobile alert (like:- Are you Awake? Yes | No). \
or by the voice input (like:- if it is yes then timer will reset and songs will play. Else it will stop playing). \
**Target audience**:- users who use Spotify while sleeping
**Benefit to Spotify**:- User firendly
